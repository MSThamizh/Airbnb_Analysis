# Airbnb Data Analysis and Visualization

This project focuses on analyzing Airbnb listing data to uncover trends in pricing, availability, and location-based insights. By leveraging tools such as MongoDB Atlas for data storage, Streamlit for building an interactive application, and Tableau/Power BI for advanced visualizations, this project aims to provide a comprehensive view of the Airbnb market.

## Problem Statement

The goal of this project is to develop a **Streamlit application** that enables users to explore and analyze Airbnb data efficiently. The application should provide the following features:

- **Data Retrieval**: Retrieve and manage Airbnb listings data from MongoDB Atlas, including geospatial data, pricing information, availability patterns, and neighborhood insights.
- **Data Cleaning**: Address missing values, duplicates, and convert data types to ensure the dataset is ready for analysis.
- **Geospatial Visualization**: Allow users to interact with maps showing Airbnb listing locations and other geospatial insights.
- **Price Analysis**: Explore pricing trends based on location, property type, and seasonal variations.
- **Availability Patterns**: Visualize availability and occupancy trends across different seasons or months.
- **Location-Based Insights**: Provide neighborhood-level insights into pricing, reviews, and listing density.
- **Dashboard Creation**: Offer advanced dashboards using Power BI with interactive filters and visualizations.

## Workflow

The workflow for this project can be summarized as follows:

1. **Data Retrieval from MongoDB**: Fetch data from the Airbnb dataset stored in MongoDB Atlas. This includes geospatial data, prices, availability, and more.
2. **Data Cleaning and Preparation**: Clean the data by addressing missing or incorrect values and converting them into the correct format.
3. **Geospatial Analysis**: Perform geospatial analysis using libraries like Geopandas and Folium to visualize listings on a map.
4. **Price and Availability Analysis**: Analyze pricing and availability patterns using dynamic charts and visualizations.
5. **Streamlit Web Application**: Build an interactive web app for users to explore data through dynamic filters and maps.
6. **Power BI Dashboards**: Combine insights into a comprehensive dashboard for presenting key findings.

## Features

- **MongoDB Integration**: Retrieve real-time Airbnb listing data from MongoDB Atlas for analysis.
- **Interactive Maps**: Geospatial visualizations allow users to explore Airbnb listings on an interactive map.
- **Dynamic Price Analysis**: Visualize pricing trends over time, location, and property type.
- **Availability and Occupancy Analysis**: Explore availability trends by season, month, or neighborhood.
- **Neighborhood Insights**: Provide location-specific insights into Airbnb pricing, listing density, and availability.
- **Tableau/Power BI Dashboards**: Advanced dashboards for presenting data insights in an interactive format.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Main programming language for data processing and application development.
- **MongoDB Atlas**: NoSQL database used to store Airbnb data.
- **Streamlit**: Python framework used to build the interactive web application.
- **Plotly**: For creating interactive charts and dynamic visualizations.
- **Power BI**: Tools for building comprehensive, interactive dashboards.
- **Pandas/Numpy**: For data manipulation and analysis.
